The majority of the site is based on this SoftLand Bootstrap template: https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/SoftLand/
The images of the people dancing to music are from https://undraw.co/search

I changed the bootstrap template in a few ways, such as changing images on the home and about page, deleting testimonial section, adding an embedded spotify iframe (I was inspired to do this by Samuel Javal, because I saw him do it and thought it was a fantastic idea). I changed all of the content from the template to mirror my own platform, Rateio, which included paring down pages that were unecessary and modifying the navbar appropriately. I also added in a few bits of custom CSS to do things like center and properly scale images, make bits more responsive, such as centering text on smaller browser sizes. Furthermore, I added my own favicon from https://icons8.com/icons/set/radio, and used the undraw images for my opengraph content so it would show a nice image when you send the website on messenger and other platforms. 

I highly reccomend checking out the "about" section to learn a little bit more about the fantastic Rateio team :)
